  paragraphs: [
    `Growing up in the agricultural heart of the Central Valley, my early environment was defined by farming rather than technology. My journey into computer science began unexpectedly in high school. I wanted to help small, immigrant-owned businesses in my community generate much-needed publicity, so I taught myself how to build websites. What started as a simple desire to support local entrepreneurs, along with my interests in GPUs for gaming, all together snowballed into a fascination with modern technology.`,

    `Before college even began, I fell completely down the programming rabbit hole. I found myself drawn away from basic web development and pulled toward highly complex, ambiguous projects that required rigorous, creative problem-solving. This intense drive ultimately led me to pursue my degree in Computer Science at UC Berkeley, where I could fully explore the theoretical and practical foundations of computation.`,

    `Today, my primary passion lies directly at the intersection of mathematics and systems, specifically within the realm of machine learning. I am captivated by the unique challenge of designing robust machine learning systems, maintaining a strong technical focus on distributed inference optimization, high-performance software systems, and scalable solutions for the future of global technical infrastructure.`,

    `I am driven by the same curiosity that originally sparked my first high school web project. I thrive in dynamic environments where math and efficient code converge to solve intricate challenges, so if there's an oppurtunity that you'd like me to hear about, please feel free to reach out!.`,
